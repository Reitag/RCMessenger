# RCMessenger
> RCMessenger - faster than you except!

This is a personal project where I learnt and practiced written program using the C++ programming language.

This project contains a server called IRCserver and the RCmsg messenger itself. The client has a graphical wrapper written with WinAPI, made for good UX and an icon. The server works without a graphical interface, but you can connect to it from anywhere in the world, with appropriate network settings.
